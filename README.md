# C++ Programming Internship Tasks

This repository contains a collection of programming tasks for a C++ internship. These tasks cover a range of topics and complexity levels, providing an opportunity to enhance your C++ programming skills. Below, you'll find details about each task and instructions on running and using the programs.

## Task 1: Number Guessing Game

**Description:**

Create a program that generates a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number. This task is designed to help you practice basic input/output and conditional statements in C++.



## Task 2: Simple Calculator

**Description:**

Develop a console-based calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform. This task will help you practice functions and user input handling in C++.


## Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**Description:**

Build a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other. Create a 3x3 grid as the game board and implement logic for displaying the current board, taking player input, updating the board, and checking for a win or a draw. This task involves working with arrays and conditional statements.


## Task 4: To-Do List

**Description:**

Create a console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. Implement these functionalities using functions and data structures. This task focuses on data management and interaction with user-generated data.



## Task 5: Image Processing Tool

**Description:**

Build a tool that allows users to perform various image processing operations like resizing, cropping, and applying basic filters (e.g., grayscale, blur, sharpen) to images. Implement a user-friendly console-based interface for easy interaction. This task combines file handling and algorithmic skills.
