# C++ Programming Internship Tasks

This repository contains a collection of programming tasks for a C++ internship. These tasks cover a range of topics and complexity levels, providing an opportunity to enhance your C++ programming skills. Below, you'll find details about each task and instructions on running and using the programs.

## Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
This is a simple C++ console-based game where you have to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Test your intuition and try to guess the correct number in as few attempts as possible.

**Description:**

The game generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number. This game showcases the use of `std::random_device` to generate a random number within a specified range.



## Task 2: Simple Calculator

**Description:**

Develop a console-based calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform. This task will help you practice functions and user input handling in C++.


## Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**Description:**

Build a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other. Create a 3x3 grid as the game board and implement logic for displaying the current board, taking player input, updating the board, and checking for a win or a draw. This task involves working with arrays and conditional statements.


## Simple To-Do List Application
This is a basic command-line to-do list application written in C++.
It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, viewing, marking as complete, and removing tasks.

**Features:**

Add Task: You can add tasks to your to-do list by providing a description.

View Tasks: View your to-do list, including task descriptions and their completion status.

Mark as Complete: Mark tasks as completed when you finish them.

Remove Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.

Quit: Exit the application when you're done managing your tasks.



## Task 5: Image Processing Tool

**Description:**

Build a tool that allows users to perform various image processing operations like resizing, cropping, and applying basic filters (e.g., grayscale, blur, sharpen) to images. Implement a user-friendly console-based interface for easy interaction. This task combines file handling and algorithmic skills.
